# LegEx: Legal Case Feature Extraction & Summarization

### Problem Statement
Legal professionals often need to review extensive case documents, making it time-consuming to extract relevant legal features and summarize important points. This process can be optimized using AI-driven tools.

### Why This Project Was Made
LegEx was created to streamline the process of analyzing legal cases by automatically extracting key legal features such as the legal principle, case name, year, judge name, and relevant legislation from a given legal case sentence. The project also provides a summary of the extracted features, saving valuable time and effort for legal professionals.


## Working

1. **Input**: Users provide a legal case sentence.
2. **Feature Extraction**: The tool extracts key legal features using advanced AI models (LLaMA 3.1-70B).
3. **Summarization**: Summarizes the extracted legal features for easy comprehension.
4. **Background Customization**: Customizes the background with a user-defined image.

## Technologies Used
- **Streamlit**: For building the web-based user interface.
- **LangChain_Groq**: Utilized for the LLaMA models handling legal feature extraction and summarization.
